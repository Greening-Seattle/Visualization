## Component specs:

On the development end, we will need to input traffic data and geospatial data.

The User will access the map and be able to vary the regions of Seattle as well as the year.

The map will need to interface with databases of historical datasets to be able to represent data over time.

The map will also need to interface with the prediction model to be able to display predicted changes.
