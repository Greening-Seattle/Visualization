# Visualization
The goal of this project is traffic visualization for the city of Seattle. There is a large quantity of publicly available data. These data are provided by the city and state governments on a yearly basis. This dataset can be used to better understand trends in traffic flow. In particular, the greening seattle team wants to vizualize traffic trends at different levels of granularity, on both the Street and Census Track level. Data has been collected and cleaned in the Greening Seattle Shared Repository. This repository takes these data, in geoPandas data frames and visualizes them using Follium and Bokeh.  


## Visualization Use Cases:


Visualizing emission history/predicted reductions over time and spatial areas
User: Citizens, policy makers, environmental groups; inputs??
Function: Map historical data interactive visual manner
Results: Map of area that can be varied by time

Visualize emissions prediction based on prediction model
User: Citizens, policy makers, environmental groups; provide region of interest
Function: Map predicted traffic/emissions reductions based on our predictive model
Results: Map of predictions that can be varied with time
